🛍️ Elonsol Store

A simple Front-End CRUD web page built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vanilla JavaScript (with AJAX).
It connects to a custom ASP.NET Web API backend that uses MS SQL Server, built following Clean Architecture principles with Entity Framework Core.

This project was created as part of my self-learning journey while studying the Front-End track with Route Academy.
Originally, the project used localStorage for data, but I built a real backend to practice full-stack integration and learn how frontend and backend communicate.
